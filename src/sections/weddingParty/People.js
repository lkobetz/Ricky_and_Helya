      "Helya and Leila met at Holy Cross Hospital in a delivery room. Since then she has given Helya the joy of being a big sister. Helya likes to take credit for Leila's music taste, but her talent is all her own. Leila plays multiple instruments and has sang as long as she could talk. She is also quite the fashionista and keeps the women in the household stylish. Though the youngest of the family, she is often the one with the most wisdom. ",

      "As long as Helya could remember, she’s always wanted an older sister. So she could not wait to meet Ricky’s vivacious, charming, and super cool big sis Roxanne. When they met there was an immediate bond. After all, Roxanne was the only other woman who truly understood the quirks of living with Ricky. More than that, Roxanne has become Helya’s role model and confidante. She enjoys plants, playing party games, working out, and recently discovered she has a natural talent at dairy farming.",

      "If the Mount Sinai School of Medicine introduced Jane and Helya, Central Park cultivated their friendship. While sunbathing in East Meadow, drinking wine and sporting campy fake tattoos, they bonded over their love of sad songs, tendency for mischief, and obsession with funny baby videos. If you find Helya in jail, you can be sure Jane will be there next to her. Jane is a connoisseur of movies, is always game for Mexican food, and has the most contagious laugh.",

After discovering their mutual love for Audrey Hepburn movies, they took their first trip together to Bryant Park to watch a screening of Roman Holiday. Since then their travels have taken them beyond the city, state, and country. Mary loves learning about the languages and culture of Ancient civilizations. You can experience Mary’s charm and humor on the podcast she co-hosts with Helya: To All the Rom-Coms I’ve Loved Before.",

      "Like most things magical, no one really knows where Sonya and Helya’s friendship came from. It was like the two misfit puzzle pieces finally found each other. Since then, they’ve tried to understand the important mysteries in life like why someone would pay $8 to drink a tiny vial of ginger infused water? Importantly, Sonya has shown Helya the joy of embracing the strangeness in all of us. Sonya enjoys all things derpy, dogs, dancing, and drinking beer.",

      "The Big Apple was no match when Hillary and Helya rampaged. Their shenanigans were the stuff that inspired sitcoms. What started off as a serendipitous roommate assignment by Mount Sinai Housing office became a bond only matched by peanut-butter and chocolate. They’ve seen each other through first dates, failed exams, and many many hangovers. Hillary (aka: Blond Helya) is an avid practitioner of yoga, appreciates a solid glass of whiskey, and will pull an all-nighter playing board games.",

They shared a love of reading classic literature, exploring the art scene of NYC, and trying exotic food. Many times they’ve found themselves engrossed for hours in thought provoking and philosophical conversation.  Along with the arts, Jasleen enjoys traveling, discovering unique brunch spots, fashion, and having drinks with good friends.",

      "Where Larissa and Helya met is up for debate: It was either in French Club or the Satire News Paper at Tuscarora HS. It may have been neither. Whatever it was it nurtured a blossoming friendship that has spanned 15 years, multiple continents, and countless spontaneous dance nights. Larissa is wicked smart and a phenomenal writer. Helya and Ricky are honored to have her officiate their marriage.",
